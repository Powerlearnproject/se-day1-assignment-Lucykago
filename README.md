Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the use of engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software.
Its importance in the technology industry is that it enables the creation of softawre applications and systems that powers various apsects of human life .

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages example the Plankalkul by Konrad between 1943 to 1945.
Establishment of software engineering disciplines in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1960s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning and Analysis.Here one evaluates the feasibilityof creating the product.
Define requirements.this phase guides the development of several documents exmaple the use case document.
Design.The original plan is elaborated into a software design document that includes the design ,template and programming languages.
Deevelopment.The development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirements into code that makes the product.
Testing.The Quality Assurance team perform validation testing to make sure the product created is functioning properly.
Deployment.The final product is delivered to the intended user.
Maintenance.Users find bugs and errors that were missed in the earlier tessting and the bugs are fixed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology has a sequential approach with distinct phases while Agile uses a iterative and incremental approach .
Waterfall is more linear ,that is it limits the team's ability to diverge from the project plan at different stages of the Software Development Life cycle,while Agile gives teams a margin of flexibility at each stage of the software development life cycle enabling them to change the course of the project.
Agile method leads to faster release of the software ,while waterfall leads to slower release due to the linear method where each phase has a completion time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software developer is responsible for writting code and implementation of software solutions.
A Quality Assuarence Engineer ensures software quality by designing the executing test plans.
A Project Manager oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The integrated development Environments provide tools for writting ,debugging and testing code e.g Visual Studio Code,Eclipse.
The Version Control systems track changes to source Code and cordinating work examples GIT,Subversions.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing the product requirement this can be overcome by agile methodology and effective communication
Tight deadlines.This can be overcome by prioritization of tasks.
Technical Debt.Regular reassessment of project goals and timeline can solve this.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing.Testing individual components or module software.
Intergrating Testing.Testing interractions between different components and subsystems.
System Testing.Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing.testing the software against user requirementss to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting a piece of instructions that is used to generate natural language responses from a langugae model
Its importance with interacting with the AI models is creating prompts that lead to high qulaity responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt:"write an email"  
improved prompt:"write a marketing email,promoting a new AI product and highlight this features"
